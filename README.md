## Features
- User Registration and Login
- Adding Items to Shopping Cart
- Viewing Cart and Checkout

## Usage
- User Registration and Login: Users can sign up for an account or log in if they already have one. Passwords are securely hashed and stored in the database.
- Adding Items to Shopping Cart: Users can browse through products and add items to their shopping cart by clicking the "Add to Cart" button.
- Viewing Cart and Checkout: The shopping cart page displays all selected items along with their prices. Users can review their items and proceed to checkout.

## Challenges and Solutions
- Displaying User Profile Name: Initially, there was difficulty displaying the logged-in user's name in the navbar. This was resolved by passing the username as a URL parameter and updating the navbar link dynamically using JavaScript.
- Updating Shopping Cart Total: Initially, the shopping cart total did not update when items were added. This was resolved by calculating the total price dynamically based on the items in the cart.
